## Handling Waste

### Disposal and Recycling
[E-Waste](https://www.melbourne.vic.gov.au/residents/waste-recycling/Pages/electronic-waste.aspx) is anything with a plug, cord or battery. Can be dropped off at a bin at the [Library at the Dock](https://goo.gl/maps/LDeJceVcp2EYL64j6). 

[Regular Recycling](https://www.melbourne.vic.gov.au/residents/waste-recycling/Pages/what-goes-in-your-bins.aspx) information is available on the City's website.

**Soft Plastics** are any plastic that can be scrunched into a ball. Recycled through [REDCycle] (https://www.redcycle.net.au/) bins. There is one at the [Woolworths Victoria Harbour](https://goo.gl/maps/VTkar8MUc9cd8F7m9). 

### Composting

How can we use indoor composting to further reduce waste going to landfill?
